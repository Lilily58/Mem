## 📋 What is Mem?

Mem is a tool that helps your digital assistant remember important facts. It mixes different methods to store and find information easily. This lets your assistant keep track of conversations and facts — even over long periods.

Inside Mem, there are three main parts working together:

- **SQLite:** A simple database that stores all your data safely.
- **FTS5:** A feature that makes it easy to search the stored information by keywords.
- **Chroma:** A system that helps find relevant facts using meaning, not just exact words.

This mix creates a memory skill that remembers and finds facts fast and well.
